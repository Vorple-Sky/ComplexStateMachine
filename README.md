# ComplexStateMachine
 by Hannah Gabany

 This project uses most of the code practeces we went over in class. I used arrays to save and change the two scores I decieded to track. Money and Happiness, not much is changed from the clickables layout. However, I did clean up the code and add my comments explaining certin functions added to the sketch file.
